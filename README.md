# file2pic
Converts any file into an Image

Syntax:

file2pic.pl <File>

After giving file2pic a file, it will prompt you for an aspect ratio for the output image.
It will also prompt for a speed factor. This dictates how many pixles it will process at the same time.
Currently it can handle a maximum of 1 fulle line at a time. 

Other types of images are planned but right now it only supports output of bitmap images.
